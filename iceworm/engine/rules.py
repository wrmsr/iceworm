TODO:
 - *not* named macro cuz jinja
 - macros return lists of / yield strs, statements
  - maybe other things but prob not
 - test harness
 - debug as py
 - pure ops - pandas
 - omnibus.interp
 - opinionated src layout - git vs zipfile
 - static ana - not just no getattr but take both if branches
 - know expr origins of branches, can tell if const
 - middle ground between whitebox and interpreted: importlib hook, enforce only touching api
  - iceworm.api vs iceworm_api.. latter safer, former more 'convenient' for deployment
  - same shit as omni.dev, sorta? would publish iw.zip + iw-api.zip
 - macros not discarded, macros not 'function calls'
  - macros are just ops, with an associated user-defined function that consumes it and emits more ops
  - maybe can get injected
  - 'call's? are removed from plan but retained for diagnosis, and are first class citizens - can be operated on
   - cifer 'metrics' are not discarded into a nest of tasks

yes:
- loops
- jinja (much stricter context but loops okay)
- maybe sqla core
- core api
- maybe in-repo file io

no:
- env vars - api.config('key'), returns *placeholder* like bindparam
- db io
- service io
- current date/time (use sa.func.now(), rewritten in transforms)
- 'run' date/time - no concept of that

- 'query': string literal, file: sql/py
- when py, a module containing a function named 'query', *injected*
- def query(now: iwa.now) -> str: â€¦
- setup.py entrypoint format - default 'query' or 'foo.py:q1'
