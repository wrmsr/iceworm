TODO:
 - class Id? like Ref? comparison validity via issubclass? or, due to cyclic def, just refuses to cmp vs str?
 - 'project'? 'world'?
  - 'mount'-like 'grafts' of dirs with configs: mangling, templating, etc
 - sql files, directory structure, yamls, generators
  - datagrip as ide? .sql scripts out of order, go-to-def?
  - subdirs as schemas?
  - sql files could start with 'use <conn>'
  - * temp / scoped tables *
  - ** temp / scoped funcs - table and scalar **
  - temp elements gc'd whenever possible, code to cleanup zombies
  - make json comments the norm?
 - lib freestanding, cfg in monorepo? up to datasci really
 - pluggable mangling - users can write cifer$abc, run in datagrip goes to users schema, mangled at load by iw
  - mangling here is for datagrip / user, not ice - ice doesnt need it
 - 'scopes' not files
  - lol, whoa, scoped sql variables?
  - files written as executable tests?
  - no if statements = actually good - explicitly take 'both sides'
 - accept vs reject vs ignore replace
 - modeling something as simple as an if statement from cfg service..
  - flatten?
  - patmatcher
  - idiom: insert into foo select * from bar where exists (select 1 from config where key = 'a' and value = 'b')
   - optimize fact config is 'static' and known, convert into if statement
   - optimize away inserts from known empty tables
   - support in ctes
 - loops
  - tbl funcs vs star templates
  - either way an expansion, but table funcs more powerful
 - dc style 'profiles' on tables?
 - lol, templated (which always means jinja) sql files
  - header can declare deps, injected into context: {foo: Foo, bar: 'Bar[int]'}
 - 'internal'?
 - individual 'processed' anns
 - tok: 'push complexity to the plan' - obv cant as much, but still have ops to xform
  - but recursive as ops contain query trees
  - is there an equiv of 'jitfuncs'? basic blocks? everything between joins? everything between cross-conn joins?
   - everything between *elements*?
  - can still split, is not opaque, can analyse into
  - simplifies viz
  - does split/merge happen on the fly? reactive coalescing?
 - insert into pagerduty.alerts (to, body) select 'dp@cb.com', 'not enough things' where (
     select count(*) from (select null from things where ds = today() limit 5)) < 5
  - lol, system table of failures, insert into pagerduty.alerts select â€¦ from system.failures where table_name = ...
 - give everything a name? type:filename:line:col:seq?
 - id lookup suggestion ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html#difflib.get_close_matches )
 - custom datatypes, desugared to binary + udfs? proto?

** *NOT* nested **

blob:
 - really, 'state' as configured by 'build' can be considered just a bigass sql file - a giant mass of creates / inserts
 - could be shipped to service without flip
 - like, sorta - 1G csvs could but shouldn't
 - still want pre-verification
 - task/thread/subsystem that frequently writes connector schemas somewhere
  - to s3, a-p (sites?) can use for pre-verification
 - lol, meta, written to an s3 connector, tables all the way down
 - need connectors? have connectors?
 - 'create connector'? borderline bad divergence from snowflake, but all-sql is powerful
 - really all sql with hot comments
